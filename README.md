# Vehicle-CDN

The project aims to design, implement, and evaluate a VANET-Based SDN-CD system to address the unique challenges of content delivery in vehicles. VANETs are dynamic networks with rapidly changing topologies and intermittent connectivity, making traditional content delivery approaches inefficient. This project proposes a novel solution that leverages Software- Defined Networking (SDN) to enhance content delivery efficiency. The solution proposed will be key to enhancing user safety and passenger convenience, such as entertainment, increased accuracy in GPS technology, and connectivity between vehicles. In the past there was no mode of communication between vehicles, only between vehicle to infrastructure. By implementing this, it could   communication which could lead to advancement in autonomous vehicles.

This project was for tackling Vehicle Ad hoc Netoworks VANET content distribution. This project creates mobile vehicles that are able to move within a specific traffic block with the assumption that these vehicles are always connected to an Access Point (AP), as an example of Vehicle to infrastructure networks (V2I). If not then a vehicle is connected towards another vehicle, this is an example of Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) networks. If neither of these apply, then a vehicle is determined to be too far to be communicated with.

Beyond the configurationn of the topology. A vehicle is linked to an Access Point which is linked to a Server which caches all files sent from a vehicle. In this project it was determined that V2I infrastructure while slower in terms of links need for file transfer, is much more secure. There is an implementation of encryption between any vehicle communication however could not be tested properly due to not knowing how to block off some vehicles from each other.
